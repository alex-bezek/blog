## üößüöß Todo List üößüöß

Below is a hodge podge list of notes and issues I want to track but don't want to make full issues for yet.

* make a cool 404 page https://gohugo.io/templates/404/
* Posts list are alphabetical, but they should be chronological imo
* setup script that can optimize images or see if i can configure the bot. The sizes could be smaller and we can be more aggressive
* make github social preview https://www.d-hagemeier.com/en/articles/generate-social-media-preview-images/ and this https://medium.com/swlh/explore-new-github-readme-feature-7d5cc21bf02f
* images for cards don't always scale to all be the same height
* Make it so figures expand their images for viewing full screen
* Google Lighthouse
  * Random Articles:
    * https://martijnvanvreeden.nl/10-ways-to-improve-your-hugo-website-performance/
  * Performance:
    * Image size optimizations
      * Look into moving images into content folder so its part of the hugo asset pipeline
        * https://regisphilibert.com/blog/2018/01/hugo-page-resources-and-how-to-use-them/
        * https://scripter.co/hugo-leaf-and-branch-bundles/
        * https://github.com/spech66/hugo-best-practices#content-organization
    * Unused CSS in bootstrap.min.css (my domain) and all.min.css (cloudflare)
    * unused jquery (my domain)
    * perhaps bundle css/js without moving to webpack https://github.com/spech66/hugo-best-practices#css-and-javascript
    * preconnect to cloudflare for assets
    * Fix font loading
    * Images explicit width/height
    * perhaps lazy load disqus as it takes a while https://blog.kulman.sk/delaying-disqus-comments-to-save-requests/
  * Accessability:
    * Nav hamburger button needs accessible name or aria label https://web.dev/button-name/?utm_source=lighthouse&utm_medium=devtools
    * Avatar needs alt text (also for SEO)
    * Card images need alt
    * Card links need meaningful name https://web.dev/link-name/?utm_source=lighthouse&utm_medium=devtools
    * Read buttons on cards need more contrast
    * header elements don't follow semantic html ordering
    * Smooth scroll links in footer don't meet minumum 48x48 tap target size
    * Search form is missing a label
    * html is missing lang attribute on posts page
    * Search bar list UL contains a div
    * markdown `highlight` produces bad contrast ratio
  * Progressive web app
    * Looks like there is no auto install, need to setup a manifest and service worker. Will need to be able to include the script in the html though
  * SEO
    * Posts page missing meta description
    * https://moz.com/blog/the-ultimate-guide-to-seo-meta-tags
    * site map, keyword searches, robots.txt
    * https://schema.org/ https://github.com/spech66/hugo-best-practices#add-a-schemaorg-partial
    * https://seorch.de/ https://varvy.com/
