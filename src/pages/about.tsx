                I'm a full stack engineer that loves bouncing between projects and learning new things.

              <p>
                I have moved back and forth between individual contributor, team lead, and an "in house consultant" of sorts joining random teams to help out with their projects.

              <p>
                I have done a heavy amount of work across the stack. Over the years, I have jumped between building a front end react component library, designing and building full SPA's with react + redux, building core functionality for Ruby on Rails apps, designing and implementing SOA based products, and a large amount of work building and standardizing our Automated and Continous Delivery mechanisms via Jenkins, Docker, and Spinnaker
